# Solar-MPPT
***************************************************************
The basic functionality of the device is based on previous generation Solar MPPTs, but it is fully autonomous (alpha ver) using ESP32 as microcontroller.
The file named `MPPT_Port-Xtensa.ino` code is final port of MPPT on the ESP32. Also, `MPPT_Port-328P.ino` shows an overview of how MPPT will work with ATMega328P microcontroller (with reduced functionality).It is equipped with 20*4 Character LCD (for device & energy status), Function Buttons, ESP32 Microcontroller, Solar Inlet, 30A FUSE, Sleep Mode, Webserver, 2 x PT-100(for Indoor & Outdoor Temp.), RS-232 Interface(at 9600),Program Serial(at 115200), Internal DIP Switches (for system configuration), Relay driven Outputs(for automation purpose), I/O for interfacing external sensors and automation purpose. The live status is displayed on LCD, the Webserver(at 192.168.1.1) to freely receive updates on PC/smartphone as well as the data log can be viewed via both RS-232 (DB9) or USB A Serial ports. Refer README.md and attached datasheets for furthur details on MPPT.
